So today I was able to get something actually usefull from my youtube downloader.
It works quite well and I believe it can be the subject of some app building in the future since the download part is now over.

When I was looking for a tutorial, I saw an article talking about Flask and OH BOY does that look more convenient than Django to build some small apps.
I'm on the tutorial, and I hope I can get something out of it !
I really like python, and I will dej make it my first language. The other will be C and I'll be done I believe, that will make me a boss if I know some linux with this as well.
