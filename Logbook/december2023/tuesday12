Now is the time I had to choose something to do for the week.
A Djago app ? Kinda no idea and that would take more than a week and turn me into CSS and JS (React Learning) wich we do not want yet.
I have decided to keep going on my python journey and I must say this wasn't what I expected.
After looking at a youtube video that talked about some project that you can do in order to gain some tech cred,
there was a thing using youtube API. Great Idea, I've wanted to build something out of it for quite a time, probably related to music, nightcore for exemple.
But here comes the catch, you have to setup a wholeload of shit in order to be able to use the API.
After setting up my account on the google cloud services platform,I created a new project from the console, from here, you can access many services, including APIs.
Once that's done, you can generate an API key to use into your code.
Also, some API feature require a client-settings.json thing that I almost figured out from the console thing.
Having to activate and validate my app to access the google account and be able to use the API.
Anyway, I believe this might work in the future but I'm not sure it will today.

This afternoon, I'm working on refactoring, cleaing and implementing some integration features to my CTF-Tools repository.

I actually managed to detect the system on wich is running the programm, and it looks like "platform" is quite a usefull toll just like os.
I will not try it on windows for now as I am too adicted to this new Fedora OS.
A nice little challenge that is incomming will be to refactor the dirlist and the filelist into a single function.

I can't wait to learn more about the Youtube API soon.

Also, somehow I should try and find some kind of job.
I know I could potentially stay at home for now and do my own stuff, but at some point I will have no choice but to one.
I still have about more than a month to get to it. Farming until then !
