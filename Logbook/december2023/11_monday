Today I got my diploma in the mailbox. That was not the big relief I expected at first. Indeed, I realised I had no doubt I would succeed.
So here we are, I'm now an official web developer and I don't even know where I want to work.
I've been quite happy to develop a web app for C2LSolutions during my training and it was an overall good experience to learn about PHP and Symfony.
But I think what I got from it is the actual feeling that I'm able to wok in that industry.
Since I've had my exam 2 week ago, I've started to get a deeper knowledge into python, finished the Django tutorial today, 
got interrested in cybersecurity via CTF and switched OS from windows to Linux Fedora.
I feel a little bit overwhelmed and can't really express what I'm currently experiencing, I feel like I know nothing that would be usefull in an actual work.
I know I'm ablen but the feeling is still here. Altho, I started to see that my slow introductions to Linux, Python etc, are starting to pay off.
I'm kind of proud of the little python project for Forensics that I have made and I look further to keep building it. Knowledge is getting inside me if we can say so.
So that was kind of the intro. I think I have made my mind into what kind of dev I want to be.
C, Python, Linux... That also includes SQL, Cybersec... AND THAT'S ALOT !
Not forgetting to mention that I look forward to become a senior dev. In order to do so, I will learn about design patterns.
If I get good enough, maybe I'll actually be able to become a freelance at some point.
