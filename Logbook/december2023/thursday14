Didn't commit to the log book yesterday.
What I mostly did was refactor the CTF tool a bit more and finally get to work with that Youtube API.
I works quite well but it was stange to process the output. Formating from json to dict, to get the urls etc.
In the end I'm able to get some nice thing working out.
So today, I might have to finish the ownload mp3 part and manage to group all this. Let's go !
