A commit a day keeps boredom away !

I became a developer because I was bored in the army. Yes really.
Not that the work of a non-commissioned officer is difficult, but as I am constantly looking for an intellectual challenge, it was more relevant for me to leave the regiment and launch myself into coding.

Let's forget the image of the bloodthirsty warrior, I repaired radio telecommunications... and was a shooting monitor, I designed and printed weapons parts with a 3D printer... in the middle of the Malian desert.
I trained staff, managed sensitive material, supervised teams, groups, and sometimes even entire platoons! In short, a busy first life which brought me many "soft-skills" as they say, and above all lots of anecdotes to tell at the caf√©.

Too little for me though. I wanted to become an elite programmer, the kind who frantically taps on his keyboard to solve problems. I followed a 6-month training course at ENI IT school and completed an internship at C2L Solutions to develop their new web application.

Newly graduated, I continue to train on my own, I am particularly interested in development practices in order to quickly become a senior developer, as well as CTF and cybersecurity.

I am looking to master python and linux by the end of 2024.

Every day brings me closer to 10,000 hours.
